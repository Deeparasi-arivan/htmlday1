    <h1>List of Rajinikanth Movies</h1>
    <p>
      Shivaji Rao Gaikwad[a] (born 12 December 1950), known professionally as
      Rajinikanth (/rəˌdʒɪnɪˈkɑːnt/ rə-JIN-ih-KAHNTH),[b] is an Indian actor,
      screen writer, and producer who works mainly in Tamil cinema.[5] In a
      career spanning over five decades, he has done 169 films that includes
      films in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, and Malayalam. He is
      widely regarded to be one of the most successful and popular actors in the
      history of Indian cinema.[6][7] Known for his uniquely styled lines and
      idiosyncrasies in films, he has a huge fan base internationally and has a
      cult following. The Government of India honoured him with Padma Bhushan in
      2000, Padma Vibhushan in 2016, India's third and second highest civilian
      honours, and highest award in the field of cinema Dadasaheb Phalke Award
      in 2019 for his contributions to Indian cinema.[8][9] Rajinikanth

      list) Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama Apoorva
      Raagangal, Rajinikanth's acting career commenced with a brief phase of
      portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. His major positive role
      as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman's Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri (1977),
      1978's Mullum Malarum and Aval Appadithan received him critical acclaim;
      the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best
      Actor.[10][11] By the end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian
      film industries and established a career in Tamil cinema. He then played
      dual roles in the action thriller Billa (1980), a remake of the Hindi film
      Don (1978). It was his biggest commercial success to that point, earned
      him stardom and gave him the action hero image.[12] He starred in triple
      role in Moondru
